 # Portfolio Website
 This is a simple portfolio website design using HTML and CSS.
 I have used semmantic html tags which automatically makes the website responsive without using any additional tools or libraries.
 ## Components
 The folder **lib** contains *components.html* file that has all the components which are used to design the website.
